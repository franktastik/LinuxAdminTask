Question: System Admins team has noticed some DNS resolution on App server 2. So we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on server.


Solution

Login to App Server 2 by:  
ssh steve@172.16.238.11

Your App server can be different. Check it from your question.


Edit the resolv.conf file in vim editor
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

Add the following nameservers 

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

Save it and quit from vim by pressing ESC and then Shift+ZZ on keyboard . See this screenshot below of resolv.conf file to understand the format

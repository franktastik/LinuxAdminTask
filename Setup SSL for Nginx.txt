The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 3 in a Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

Install and configure nginx on App Server 3.

1. On App Server 3 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

2. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

3. For final testing try to access the App Server 3 link (either hostname or IP) from the jump host using the curl command. For example curl -Ik https: // <app-server-ip> /.
  


#Login to the server as Root. 

#Check OS version 
    cat /etc/os-release or 
    

#While Nginx is not available in CentOSâ€™s default repositories, it is present in the EPEL (extra packages for Enterprise Linux) repository. We can enable the EPEL repository to give our server access to the Nginx package by typing
    sudo yum install epel-release

#install Nginx by typing
    sudo yum install nginx


    ll /tmp


#Edit Nginx conf &  do the changes as below.  Note Server_name IP should be the as per your app server mentioned in the task 
    vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

#Once the configuration is saved then copy the certificates and key
    cp /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/
    cp /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/pki/CA/private/

    ll /etc/pki/CA/certs


    cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep root 


#Create an index.html  with the word Welcome! is Nginx document root. rm old index.html. Create a new one using vi command. 
    ll /usr/share/nginx/html/
    rm /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    vi /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

#Verify 
    cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

#Start the Nginx service by typing:
    sudo systemctl start nginx

#Check that the service is up and running by typing:
    systemctl status nginx

#You will also want to enable Nginx, so it starts when your server boots:
    sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Validate the task from the  JUMP server  
    curl -Ik https: // stapp03

#save the file and restart the Service
sudo cp /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs 
sudo cp /tmp/nautilus.key  /etc/pki/CA/private
sudo systemctl restart nginx 
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo echo  Welcome!>>index.html
sudo mv index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
sudo yum install curl -y
curl -Ik https://172.16.238.10  ## use ip of app server

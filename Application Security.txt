We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 6300 and 8094, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:
We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.


Solution

#Check the telnet connection from the jump server using the two port number. Both port number will accpet connection
    telnet ServerName port_number

#Login to backup server and add these two rules
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <port_number> -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <port_number> -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT
#ave it by typing following command
    sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

#Check if the rules are added or not
    cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables
#Check the telnet connection from the jump server using the two port number. Only one port will accept connection
    telnet ServerName port_number

During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on the Nautilus App Server 1 server in Stratos DC. They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below:

a. On Nautilus App Server 1 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/blog on App Server 1. It was detected that the directory /blog lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.


SOLUTION

#Login to the App server as a root user 


#Start the httpd service
    systemctl status httpd | grep 
    systemctl -l status service-name 
    systemctl start httpd

    journal -xe 

# Check the log 
    journal -o verbose _PID=<Process number>
    journalctl -u service-name
    journalctl -u service-name.service 

    journalctl -xefu service-name 
    systemctl log named.service --since=today 
    
# Verify the server token, Server Signature and indexes
    cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep ServerTokens
    cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep ServerSignature 
    cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep indexes 


#create .conf file in the directory /etc/httpd/conf/
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
Load config files in the "/etc/httpd/conf.d" directory, if any.

#Add Server token, Server Signature and indexes under IncludeOptional conf.d/*.  Under the document root directory, change the Options indexes FollowSymLinks to Options FollowSymLinks
    ServerTokens Prod
    ServerSignature Off 

#Start the httpd service 
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl status httpd

#Validate the task by using the curl http command

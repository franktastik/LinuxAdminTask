QUESTION:
Nautilus production support team was trying to fix some issues with their storage server. 
Storage server has a shared directory /nfsshare which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /nfsshare can be shared among all app servers. 
Now somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.
Identify the root cause of issue and fix the same to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.



SOLUTIONS:
ssh into the server and change to root. 
ssh username@ip or domain

#Change config file
  vi /etc/exports 

#Check for service
  rpcinfo -p and you will see if it is active or inactive

#Start the Service
  service nfs start  OR
  systemctl start nfs.service OR
  systemctl restart nfs

#Check the service status
  service rpcbind status

Go to any of the app server and use #showmount -e <server ip>
Then,  mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/nfsshare /mnt/nfsshare (shared file)
Same will have to be done for other servers. 

To check, you can create a file in the shared directory
exportfs -ra ---- it shows what is mounted

use mount | nfs grep to confirm the mount

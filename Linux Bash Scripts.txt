The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named blog_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2)



a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_blog.zip of /var/www/html/blog directory.

b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.

c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.

d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.

#Login to server not as a root user 

#Enter to the script folder 
    cd /script

# Go to the script folder and create a backup script 
    vi /<script folder>/.sh

#Add the script 

    #!/bin/bash
    zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_media.zip /var/www/html/media
    scp /backup/xfusioncorp_media.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup/

#Verify
    cat /<script folder>.sh

#Exit the script folder. 

#create a keygen and copy the key to the backup server so that the bash script will not require any password  
    ssh-keygen

#Copy the key on the backup server & cross-check login without password prompt 
    ssh-copy-id username@servername 

#Go to the scripts folder and run the bash scripts by this command  
    sh <script name>.sh

#Check the backup folder for the zip file on both app02 and backup server. If you find the zip file then it should be done. Login into both server and run the command below 
    ll /backup

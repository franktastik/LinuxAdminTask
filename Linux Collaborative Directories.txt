The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups / teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the systemadmin group of the team.

Setup a collaborative directory systemadmin/data on the Nautilus App 1 server in the Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group systemadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read / write / execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.


STEPS 

Login to the App server and make root 

Create a directory 

mkdir -p <directory path>

Check the permission for the new directory created.  Get information about a directory. 

ls -ld <directory path>

Changes the user and group of the specified file or directory

chown -R root:<group name> <directory path> 

N.B: To undo the above command as a root user. Use chown mynewuser.mynewuser /home/mynewuser

or Change the group of the directory from the root to the mentioned group in the task. chgrp = changing primary group for the directory. -R = recursive. changes will reflect all sub-directories and files

chgrp -R <group name> <directory path> . as a root user. 

Verify 

ls -ld <directory path> 
ll -lsd <directory path> . Displays directory info with the permission info 


Change permission of the new directory

chown chmod -R 2770 <directory path>

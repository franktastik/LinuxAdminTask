QUESTION:

xFusionCorp Industries has an application running on Nautlitus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter. 
The monitoring tool recognised that there is an issue with the haproxy service on LBR server. 
That needs to fixed to make the application work properly. Troubleshoot and fix the issue, and make sure haproxy service is running on Nautilus LBR server.

SOLUTION:

HAProxy application is used to distribute the workload across multiple servers such as web server, 
database server. This improves the overall performance and reliability of server environment.

#"sudo haproxy -c -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg" --- Used to check for errors

from the error, I realized that the service is not active, therefore, we need to start and enable the haproxy service

  sudo systemctl start haproxy
  sudo systemctl enable haproxy
  sudo systemctl status haproxy

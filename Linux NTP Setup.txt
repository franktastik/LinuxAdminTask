The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers. They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 2. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:

Install and configure NTP server on App Server 2.

Add NTP server 2.oceania.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 2.

Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.


Steps 

ssh into the system 

sudo su 

# install the ntp service
yum install ntp -y 
yum install -y ntp 

# Edit the configuration file and add the ntp server 
vi /etc/ntp.conf 

# enable, start and check the status of the ntp deamon service. 


# Once the ntp.conf is configured with correct settings, start the ntp daemon or restart the ntpd service. 

/etc/init.d/ntp start

N.B: If the above is not working, restart the service

# Status
ntpq -p or ntpstat 

# to get the current status of ntpd
ntpdc -c sysinfo

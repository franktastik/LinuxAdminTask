The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.


a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package samba from this newly created repo.


#Login to the Backup server as a root user

#Check is there any yum repository is available 
    yum repolist 

#View the files in a directory
    ls /directory

#cd into the repo 
    /etc/yum.repos.d

#Create a local repo since there is no repo 
    vi repo_name

    @vi /etc/yum.repo.d/<repo id>.repo # You can use this command if you are not in the directory /etc/yum.repos.d 

    vi repo_name.repo

#Add the file 

    [repo id]
    name=<repo_name>
    baseurl=file:///package_location/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

#
    ls 

#Check to create repo listed  
    yum repolist

#Rename the repo name to a .repo file extension. when we create repo file it should be with .repo extension. Syntax = Move <repo> to <repo>.repo  
    @mv repo_name repo_name.repo.# You can use this command only if your vi command is = vi repo_name.#It doesn't have the file extension .repo 

# 
    ls 

#Check to create repo listed  
    yum repolist

#Install httpd inside the directory /etc/yum.repo.d 
    yum install httpd

#Validate the task and you will see a similar file as "httpd.x86_64 2.4.6-90.el7.centos @local_yum"
    yum list httpd

#Check to create repo listed  
    yum repolist
#Check if the package is installed in yum repo. 
    yum list <package>

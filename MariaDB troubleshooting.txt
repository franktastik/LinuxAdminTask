There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.
Look into the issue and fix the same.

Solution. 

# ssh into the db server as a root user

# Check the status of the MariaDB 

    systemctl status mysql

# Use the journal command to view the logs

    journal -xe | grep mariadb 

# Install mysql or Change ownership of mysql using the command below 

    yum install mysql

    chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql 

# Enable the mariadb, Start mariadb and check the status 

    systemctl enable mariadb or sudo systemctl start mariadb.servic
